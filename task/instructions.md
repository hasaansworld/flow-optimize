Here are the key components of the wastewater system:Tunnel / Storage Canal: This is a large underground reservoir that collects incoming wastewater (F1) before it gets pumped to the treatment plant. It acts as a buffer.L1 (Suction Level): This is the Water level in tunnel L1 (Col 2). It's the "suction" side level, meaning it's the level of water available for the pumps to draw from. A high L1 means the tunnel is full; a low L1 means it's empty. This is a critical safety and process constraint.V (Volume of water in tunnel): This is the Water volume in tunnel V (Col 3), measured in cubic meters (m³). It's directly related to the L1 level by a formula (which the challenge text says is provided).H (Head): This is the total pressure (expressed in meters of water) that a pump must work against. It's determined by the static height difference between the tunnel ($L_1$) and the discharge point ($L_2$, which is not given but is part of $H$), plus all friction losses in the pipes. The pump curves you provided directly show this value.F1 (Inflow): This is the Inflow to tunnel F1 (Col 5), representing all the wastewater (and stormwater) arriving at the storage tunnel from the city.F2 (Pumped Flow to WWTP): This is the Sum of pumped flow to WWTP F2 (Col 4). "WWTP" is the WasteWater Treatment Plant. This $F_2$ is the total output of all active pumps and is the flow being sent for treatment.📊 Explanation of Data ColumnsHere is a breakdown of the columns from your CSV file.Data DescriptionCSV ColumnsUnitExplanationTimestamp1YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSThe data is recorded in 15-minute intervals (dt 15 min).Suction level L12 (Water level... L1)mThe water level in the storage tunnel. A key constraint.Volume of water V3 (Water volume... V)m³The volume of water in the tunnel, calculated from L1.Sum of pumped flow F24 (Sum of pumped flow...

A value of 0 means the pump is off.Power intake per pump14-21 (Pump efficiency 1.1...2.4)kWImportant: The CSV header text is a typo. The unit (kW) confirms this is the Electrical Power Intake for each pump.Drive frequency per pump22-29 (Pump frequency 1.1...2.4)HzThe speed of each pump's motor, which controls its flow rate.Electricity price30 (...high), 31 (...normal)EUR/kWhTwo different time series for the energy price.📉 Understanding the Pump CurvesThe CSV data shows that the 8 pumps are not identical. For example, Pump 1.1 (Col 6) has a flow of ~1500 m³/h, while Pump 1.4 (Col 9) has a flow of ~3000 m³/h at the same frequency.The images you provided represent the performance characteristics for these different pump types.Pump Set 1 (Smaller Pumps, e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.3)Q-H Curve (Flow vs. Head): This chart shows how much Flow ($Q$) a pump can produce for a given Head ($H$) it has to fight against, at a specific Frequency (Hz).$\eta$-Q Curve (Efficiency vs. Flow): This chart shows the pump's Efficiency ($\eta$) for a given Flow ($Q$) at a specific Frequency (Hz).Pump Set 2 (Larger Pumps, e.g., 1.4, 2.1, 2.2)Q-H Curve (Flow vs. Head):$\eta$-Q Curve (Efficiency vs. Flow):⚙️ How Pump Efficiency is CalculatedThe Power intake per pump (Cols 14-21) is the Electrical Power ($P_e$) your system consumes.Pump Efficiency ($\eta$) is the ratio of the useful work the pump does (Hydraulic Power, $P_h$) to the electrical power it consumes ($P_e$).$$\eta = \frac{P_h \text{ (Hydraulic Power)}}{P_e \text{ (Electrical Power)}}$$You have $P_e$ in your data. The pump curves are used to find $P_h$ and $\eta$.The formula for Hydraulic Power is:$$P_h = \frac{Q \times \rho \times g \times H}{3.6 \times 10^6}$$Where:$P_h$ = Hydraulic Power (kW)$Q$ = Flow rate (m³/h)$\rho$ = Density of water (~1000 kg/m³)$g$ = Gravity (9.81 m/s²)$H$ = Head (m)How Your AI Will Use the Curves:Here is a step-by-step example of how your AI would use these charts to make an optimal decision:Read System State: Your AI reads the current $L_1$ level (Col 2) and the Inflow $F_1$ (Col 5). It also looks at the Electricity Price (Col 30/31) for the next few hours.Determine Target: Based on price and inflow forecasts, the AI decides to pump a total flow of $F_2$ = 5000 m³/h to lower the $L_1$ level while prices are cheap.Find Operating Point:The system's Head ($H$) is a function of $L_1$ and the total flow $F_2$. Let's assume your AI calculates the current required $H$ is 18 m.The AI needs to combine pumps to meet the 5000 m³/h target. It considers using a "Large Pump" (Set 2) and a "Small Pump" (Set 1).Large Pump: It looks at the Q-H Curve (Set 2). To achieve $H=18\text{m}$, it sees it could run the pump at 45 Hz. Following that curve to $H=18$ gives a Flow ($Q$) of ~2800 m³/h.Small Pump: It needs $5000 - 2800 = 2200 \text{ m³/h}$. This is too much for a "Small Pump" (max ~1800).New Plan: The AI tries two "Large Pumps." To get 2500 m³/h from each, it looks at the Q-H Curve (Set 2). It finds that running at ~43 Hz will produce $Q = 2500 \text{ m³/h}$ against an $H$ of ~19m (Head increases with more flow).Calculate Efficiency:The AI now knows its operating point: $Q = 2500 \text{ m³/h}$ at 43 Hz.It goes to the $\eta$-Q Curve (Set 2). It finds the 43 Hz curve and reads the efficiency at $Q = 2500 \text{ m³/h}$. This gives an $\eta$ of ~80%.Calculate Power & Cost:Now it can predict the power each pump will consume before turning it on:$P_h = (2500 \times 1000 \times 9.81 \times 19) / 3,600,000 = 129.6 \text{ kW}$$P_e = P_h / \eta = 129.6 \text{ kW} / 0.80 = 162 \text{ kW}$The AI determines that running these two pumps will cost $(162 \text{ kW} + 162 \text{ kW}) \times 0.25 \text{ h} \times \text{Price}$. It can now compare this cost to other strategies (e.g., using three small pumps, or waiting for prices to drop).🏆 How to Verify Your Results are OptimalYour goal is to demonstrate that your AI's strategy is cheaper and more efficient than the baseline (the provided historical data), while respecting all constraints.Here is the key data you must present:1. Primary Metric: Total Energy Cost (Minimize This)This is the most important metric. You must show your total cost is lower than the baseline cost.For each 15-minute step ($t$):Total Power ($P_{\text{total}, t}$): Sum the power of all 8 pumps (Cols 14-21) for that time step.Energy Consumed ($E_t$): $P_{\text{total}, t} \text{ (kW)} \times 0.25 \text{ (h)}$. (Since $dt$ = 15 min = 0.25 h).Electricity Price ($\text{Price}_t$): Get the price from Col 30 or 31.Cost for that step ($C_t$): $E_t \text{ (kWh)} \times \text{Price}_t \text{ (EUR/kWh)}$.Your Final Score: $\text{Total Cost} = \sum C_t$ (the sum of all costs over the entire period).How to win: Run this calculation on the original data to get a "Baseline Total Cost." Then, run your AI simulation. Your AI will generate new values for Pump flow, Power intake, and Pump frequency for each time step. Calculate the "AI Total Cost" using your new values. You must prove:$\text{AI Total Cost} < \text{Baseline Total Cost}$2. Secondary Metric: Specific Energy Consumption (kWh/m³)This shows how efficient your system is, regardless of price.Total Energy Consumed: $\sum E_t$ (from the cost calculation) over the whole period (in kWh).Total Flow Pumped: $\sum (F_2 \times 0.25)$ (Sum of Col 4 multiplied by 0.25 h) over the whole period (in m³).Specific Energy: $\frac{\text{Total Energy Consumed (kWh)}}{\text{Total Flow Pumped (m³)}}$.You want to minimize this ratio. A lower number means you are using less energy to pump the same amount of water.3. Critical Constraints (Don't Violate These)Your solution will be disqualified if it fails these safety checks. You must track and plot this data:Tunnel Level ($L_1$): Your AI must keep the water level (Col 2) within a safe range. It must not overflow (exceed a maximum safe level) and must not run dry (go below a minimum level, which can damage the pumps).Process Limits ($F_2$): The total pumped flow (Col 4) must respect the "strict flow limits" of the downstream WWTP. You must ensure $F_2$ never exceeds the maximum capacity the treatment plant can handle.
